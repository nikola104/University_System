# University System

This project is a WPF-based user interface that enables users to create and manage student records, including names, faculty, and specialties. It also includes a mini project for tracking employee expenses. 

Some of the technologies, techniques, and concepts covered in this project include:
- C# Core with LINQ and Delegates
- Entity Framework and Microsoft SQL for data management
- WPF for creating window applications, using XAML language, data binding, commands, and working with controls
- MVVM design pattern for structuring the application

By working on this project, I gained experience and knowledge in these areas, and I hope that this project will be helpful for others who are interested in learning more about these technologies and techniques.
